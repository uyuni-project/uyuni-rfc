- Feature Name: SUSE Manager Hub
- Start Date: 2018-08-01

# Unimplemented note

This RFC was not ultimately implemented due to time constraints. It might be revived in future.

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Hub is a new SUSE Manager component (along with Server and Proxy) that exposes a Web UI for DIY reports based on data aggregated from multiple SUSE Manager Servers.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

 - we need a way to scale SUSE Manager (as a solution) horizontally, employing several SUSE Manager Servers
 - `spacewalk-report` is a limited tool, especially considering big data centers

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

## Architecture

Hub is composed of:
  - a loader tool which is executed every X hours
    - at every run data is extracted from a set of SUSE Manager Servers, transformed and loaded
  - a Postgres database that contains aggregated data
  - a Web UI frontend application based on [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com) to navigate the aggregated data set

Hub can run on an existing SUSE Manager Server (eg. an Inter-Server Sync Master) or standalone.

SUSE Manager Servers will contain Hub-specific views that transform data into a Hub-specific format.

Loader connects to SUSE Manager Servers via Postgres connections and copies data from Hub-specific views into local tables.

Hub will be Postgres only.

## Demo

A demo server is available at:

http://10.86.0.91:3000

### How to play

[Several example queries were created](http://10.86.0.91:3000/questions).

It is possible to create new custom queries by clicking on [New Question](http://10.86.0.91:3000/question/new) and then Custom.

[An example Dashboard](http://10.86.0.91:3000/dashboard/1) was also created.

[A Metabase tutorial](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/getting-started.html) and [full Metabase documentation pages](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/) are also available.

## Data format

Hub tables follow the [snowflake schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_schema) data model common in OLAP/data warehouse applications for easy presentation and do-it-yourself customization from users. Metabase has specific features that make navigating snowflake schemas comparatively easy.

## Performance considerations

Impact on SUSE Manager Servers should be negligible - synchronization of 4 SUSE Manager Servers on a laptop takes one minute in a reasonably realistic demo (see below).

No important issues are expected with respect to performance of the Web UI:
  - Loader already operates a first selection/aggregation of data that makes the data set smaller
  - several well-known optimizations are possible on snowflake schema databases
  - Metabase behaved well in this respect in the demo

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

  - Metabase is a Clojure application, we will need to develop skillsets
  - the snowflake schema is more limited than the relational model, not all imaginable reports might be possible to implement. Metabase also has plain SQL support to cover corner cases
  - CVE Audit might not be feasible, needs more research

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

## Design

  - ship Metabase as a more general component, not tied to SUSE Manager
  - expose an API instead of connecting directly from Hub to SUSE Manager Servers' Postgres databases. Performance impacts have to be assessed
  - allow Metabase to be run on any SUSE Manager Server for local reporting

## Web UI component

Several alternatives were researched and tested:

* [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase)
  * Pros
    * Slick UI
    * Embeddable
  * Cons
    * AGPL
    * Clojure

* [Saiku](https://github.com/OSBI/saiku) Community Edition
  * Pros
    * Apache license
    * Java
  * Cons
    * Crippled chart support: https://www.meteorite.bi/saiku-product-comparison

* [SuperSet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset)
  * Pros
    * Apache incubating
    * Backed by airbnb
  * Cons
    * not really point-and-click, SQL knowledge almost required

* [Knowage](https://github.com/KnowageLabs/)
  * Pros
    * Point-and-click
  * Cons
    * AGPL
    * UI is horrible

Others have been directly discarded:

* [OpenBoquet](https://github.com/openbouquet/bouquet-js)
  * almost a "one-man show": https://github.com/openbouquet/bouquet-js/graphs/contributors?from=2017-03-05&to=2018-02-20&type=c
* [Cubes](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer)
  * almost a "one-man show", almost inactive: https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer/graphs/contributors?from=2012-12-16&to=2018-07-25&type=c
* [Imply](https://github.com/implydata)
  * front-end became closed source 2 years ago: https://github.com/geo-opensource/pivot
* [JPivot](http://jpivot.sourceforge.net/)
  * discontinued since 2008
* [Pivot4J](http://www.pivot4j.org/)
  * discontinued: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pivot4j-list/ipDSfjcvo0M
* [Apache Kylin](http://kylin.apache.org)
  * requires a Hadoop cluster among many many other components
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana)
  * assumes ElasticSearch as the backend, which takes logs as its input. As current logs are far from comprehensive for our requirements at this point, we would have to "export" data from the database to new logs first, then define import schemas in ElasticSearch to convert them into a useable format. This "double conversion" would add significant complexity
