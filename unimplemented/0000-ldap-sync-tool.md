# Unimplemented note

This RFC was not ultimately implemented in the main Uyuni codebase, although a proof of concept implementation exists. It is still archived here for historical purposes.


# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The `mgr-ldapsync` is a tool that configures and manages users in Uyuni
from a directory service.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Uyuni server can authenticate users from LDAP via PAM. For this, users
need to be added to Uyuni with the flag "PAM authentication" and thus
their credentials will be verified via LDAP directory. Synchronisation
tool should transparently synchronise users from certain groups and/or
roles in LDAP and reflect that in Uyuni server, overriding local
changes.

Due to the nature of LDAP flexibility, the synchronisation tool should
be flexible enough to reflect a range of setups.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

The tool should work as an aggregator, collecting users from LDAP and
Uyuni server synchronising them.

## Functionality Aspects

The following functions should be implemented:

- Distinguish between local users in Uyuni and LDAP users.
- Prevent UID clashes between the local users and LDAP users.
- Prevent accidental modification or removal of the local user.
- Flexible support various LDAP schemas, such as eDirectory, POSIX,
  Active Directory etc.
- Role management.
- Dry run mode (preview only).

## Configuration

Configuration should be default in a separate file
`/etc/rhn/ldapsync.conf`. Alternatively, user should be able to
specify own path, in case the default one is not created or used.

The main principle of the tool is to map specific roles and or groups
in LDAP to the roles in the Uyuni server via the configuration. Adding
or removing LDAP users from these groups or roles should reflect in
Uyuni without additional manual changes in the Uyuni server.

Configuration should be just a YAML file and the mapping should
implement a relation between LDAP group to a set of roles from
Uyuni. So each user in LDAP that is a member of such group would
inherit these roles. For example:

```yaml
directory:
  groups:
    cn=sysop,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com:
      - activation_key_admin
      - channel_admin
      - config_admin
```

The configuration above would allow creating `groupOfNames` class in
LDAP and add users via `member` attribute. As long as DN of that
member is valid LDAP object and is not clashing with the local user in
the Uyuni server, it should be synchronised. Similarly roles LDAP
objects are configured as same as `groups` but via `roles`.

## Attribute Remapping

In some certain cases may be necessary not to use standard
attribute IDs for certain governs IDs. For example
`organizationalPerson` (ID 2.5.6.7) should contain a child
`inetOrgPerson` (ID 2.16.840.1.113730.3.2.2) which _may_ contain an
attribute `uid` and usually does. But it also might not have any. On
top of that, own classes might be written with own attributes, and
they might be the only attributes to be used.

The `mgr-ldapsync` tool is using `uid` attribute as User ID. However,
this may be re-mapped in the section `maps`. For example, `allusers`
contains a DN, where all user accounts are residing. This DN should be
mentioned in `maps` section, which will for each object class in that
DN set remap given attribute to what is required. The example below
shows how to tell `mgr-ldapsync` the `uid` and `mail` attributes out
of custom made ones:


```yaml
directory:
  allusers: ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
  maps:
    ou=people,dc=example,dc=com:
      speciaUidAttr: uid
      specialMailAttr: mail
```

Section `maps` supposed to cover also DN from roles and groups.

## Frozen Users

Frozen user is a local user in Uyuni, which has verified `org_admin`
privileges (all) and is mentioned as "frozen" in the
configuration. Such user is usually used as an emergency user, in case
LDAP fails to respond and/or authenticate anyone. LDAP synchronisation
should not proceed unless there is at least one "frozen" user.

Frozen users configuration option can be also used to explicitly lock
certain UIDs, even if they are listed in LDAP. In this case "frozen"
UID should be entirely ignored by the `mgr-ldapsync` tool.

Configuration:

```yaml
directory:
  frozen:
    - administrator  # This is the UID
```

## LDAP vs Local Users

The `mgr-ldapsync` should distinguish between LDAP users and Uyuni
users, and operate adding, modifying or removing them only in LDAP
context. As long as the user is not specified in LDAP, it should be
treated as "Uyuni local users" and be ignored therefore.

## Clashed UIDs

Any UID that exists in the Uyuni server but has different
authentication method than PAM or is mentioned as "frozen users"
should be marked as conflicting and therefore ignored.

Conflicting UIDs should be not processed, but reported to the log file
as erroneous. However this should not prevent to process the rest
of the existing users.

However, any UID that has PAM authentication mode configured or is not
mentioned as "frozen user" should be managed by LDAP.

## Usage

Typical use of the `mgr-ldapsync` should be straightforward by
periodically run in cron. In console mode it should also provide a
possibility of "dry-run" where only planning of actions to be taken
will be shown.

The output should be stored either to a configured log file or to the
STDOUT, if requested.

# Uyuni UI Enhancements

Considering that this tool a new way of creating/modifying users
beside the UI and API in an automated way, there should be an API
endpoint that allows to set a flag in User Management that gives
admins the clear indication that the certain user is managed externally.

Main reason is the role mapping that is included. An admin currently
easily can change the user settings in the UI and will be wondering
why his changes get reset to the original settings. Therefore, Uyuni
UI should mark external users either with special icon or color etc
and the page of such user should have disabled "Update" button and an
explanation for such user is managed elsewhere externally.

# Reference Implementation

This is already implemented in the prototype which is available at 
[uyuni-ldap-sync repository](https://github.com/isbm/uyuni-ldap-sync).

Current prototype has two releases:
1. [v0.1](https://github.com/isbm/uyuni-ldap-sync/releases/tag/v0.1) just reimplements
[existing script in Uyuni](https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/blob/master/utils/sw-ldap-user-sync).
2. [v0.2](https://github.com/isbm/uyuni-ldap-sync/releases/tag/v0.2) implements the current RFC and adds Active Directory support

Moving from prototype status to a production release, the following
would be still required:

- Add unit tests
- Possible refactorings

## Additional Features

Features that might come with the next release:

- Automatic (transparent) PAM authentication setup/un-setup
- Daemon mode

## Native Implementation

Alternative design would be to extend user management in the very
Uyuni server, making it LDAP-aware natively. However, the amount of
changes to the existing code might be very large.

## Salt-based Implementation

It could be possible to reuse existing Spacewalk runner in Salt,
wrapping it into a state module and implement all that as a Salt
Formula. While such approach would give more flexibility to the user,
it will also have a number of drawbacks, such as:

- Additional formula debugging difficulties overhead

- User-introduced bugs that might sync LDAP wrong with severe
  consequences 

- Fragility of the very solution, since it is still an editable
  Formula

- No daemon mode. Every time LDAP database update, changes supposed to
  be just propagated transparently. For that, the job in Salt should
  be scheduled, and thus calling Salt locally would be too much of overhead

Salt, however, could periodically call `uyuni-ldap-sync` and/or setup
configuration for it (PAM, the `uyuni-ldap-sync` configuration etc).

With daemon mode implemented, Salt supposed to only setup the
`uyuni-ldap-sync` once and delegate the rest to the
`uyuni-ldap-sync`.
